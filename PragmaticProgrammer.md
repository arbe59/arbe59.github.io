# The Pragmatic Programmer

## Notes & Strategies
I started reading this book on 1/20/2025.  So far, I'm through 5 of the 9 chapters.  Below, I will document the specific takeaways I've had from what I've read, and my strategies to apply these things in both my work routines and my career development projects.

### Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

This chapter is all about the responsibility of owning and directing your own future as a software engineer, and being responsible for the work that you produce.  My main takeaway from this chapter is to take pride in my work, and to build a professional portfolio that demonstrates my ability.  Specific things to remember:
- Don't Live with Broken Windows - a single instance of poor design or poor implementation, allowed, will encourage future transgressions, both by myself and others.  When expediency temps me to make a shortcut or to "go back and fix it later", don't give in to this temptation.  That's a broken window.  When you see a freshly broken window by a colleague, call them out.
- Good Enough Software - there's no finish line.  Software that looks perfect today is out of date and incorrect tomorrow.  This isn't an invitation to engage in poor design, it's a reminder that software which is well designed and meets the user's requirements, is good enough and should be deployed.
- Knowledge Portfolio - it's kind of the inspiration for this entire site.  I want a continually maintained, demonstrable portfolio of skills, an updated (living) resume, and always a short term plan in progress for acquiring new skills.
