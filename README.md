## Overview
This page will serve as my central hub to showcase my experience, abilities, and resume.

My initial plan is to keep track of a career development plan, my resume, and a showcase of projects.

## Resume
I have an existing but out of date and I think underwhelming MS Word resume.  I want to create an interactive resume on this site that not only lists my career accomplishments and credentials, but allows visitors to see my work.

Next steps - Create a separate resume page that hosts my actual resume.


## Career Plan
Because I have always worked for .NET shops, I have remained somewhat pigeonholed in the .NET stack.  My skills and experience have grown, but at the same time, I have avoided many other tech stacks and professional skills.  I will document and track my progress through a plan to acquire and demonstrate abilities in new technologies here.

This will take the form of acquiring new knowledge through a list of books I've decided to make my way through, as well as adding projects to my repository portfolio.  Ultimately, I want this site to provide demos of these projects.

### Project Plan
In addition, I want to come up with a list of projects which can be coded in local repositories and hosted in ways that this site can link to.

- An idea I have is for a hotel management app.  Details still need to be fleshed out, but ideally it should consist of a booking system and an administration tool.  It should initially just concern itself with booking rooms.  Later, other features like a hotel, housekeeping, conference rooms, etc., can be added.

### Tomorrow is 2/15/2025
And tomorrow's plan is:
- Get the resume page created and your existing resume re-created there.  No need to worry about updating it, just get what exists moved to this markdown format for now
- Read the rest of chapter 6 of The Pragmatic Programmer
- Flesh out the takeaway notes of the remaining chapters you've already read
- Come up with a workout plan and do a workout at the gym
- Create a meal plan for the coming week, make sure everything needed is bought from the store
